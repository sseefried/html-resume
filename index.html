<h2>Employment History</h2>

<h3>BitTrade Labs (May 2016 - present)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    I took this role to gain commercial experience using blockchain
    technology. My role involves working on internal products and consulting
    to companies on the advantages and disadvantages of using blockchain
    technology.  Blockchains I have already developed software for are Bitcoin,
    Ethereum and Factom.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>IAG (September 2015 - May 2016)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Worked on an Entity Resolution platform written in Haskell.
    This particular role enhanced my ability to write concurrent,
    high performance Haskell that ran with reasonable memory requirements.
    Made heavy use of streaming libraries such as Pipes and Quiver.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Web development contractor/game developer (March 2014 - Sep 2015)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mar 2014 - present. Contracting for various web development studios
      (<a href="http://30acres.com.au">30Acres</a>,
       <a href="http://www.directclicks.com.au/">Dawson Media</a>).
    Most of the web development work is in Ruby on Rails. Database technologies are standard: MySQL
    and PostgreSQL. I'm responsible for a lot of system administration too. I use platforms such as
    Amazon Web Services, Digital Ocean, and tools such as Vagrant, Ansible and Docker to simplify
    provisioning and deployment and make it repeatable. Client work sometimes
    requires me to perform the dirty job of maintaining and extending PHP applications.
  </li>
  <li>Mar 2014 - present. Game development in Haskell.
    Developed a simple independent video game. Tired of hearing that Haskell
    couldn't be used for "real world" applications I decided to develop a game for both iOS and
    Android. I released a Docker
    <a href="https://github.com/sseefried/docker-build-ghc-android">container</a> encapsulating
    this work and the game <a href="https://github.com/sseefried/open-epidemic-game">here</a>.
    I also wrote a blog
    <a href="http://lambdalog.seanseefried.org/posts/2014-12-12-docker-build-scripts.html">post</a>
    explaining an interesting use-case for  Docker as a means of simplifying the development of
    long-running build scripts.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Senior Research Engineer, NICTA (November 2010 to March 2014)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dec 2011-Mar 2014. Working with the Verification Group in the Software Systems Research Group
     (SSRG). I did proof maintenance on the seL4 operating system kernel. NICTA is the first research
     institute in the world to have verified an operating system kernel. Program verification is
     the highest level of assurance of program correctness you can get and a lot of functional
     programming techniques are used in program verification. (The theorem prover itself is
     written in Standard ML, a close cousin of OCaml.)
  </li>
  <li>2010-Nov 2011. Researcher on the Scalable Vision Machines project &mdash; developing a Haskell
      EDSL to make the programming of GPUs much easier.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Software Engineer, Bang the Table (July 2010 &ndash; October 2010)</h3>

<ul> <li><a href="http://www.bangthetable.com">Bang the Table</a> provides moderated forums for community engagement. My
duties so far have been implementing automated testing and improving the reporting functionality.</a></li> </ul>

<h3>Software Engineer, Kinesis (December 2009 &ndash; June 2010)</h3>

<ul>

    <li> Maintained and extended existing online carbon accounting tool - <a
    href="http://kinesis.org/c-cap.html">CCap</a>. This tool allows organisations to account for their carbon emissions
    at a very fine grained level taking into account all aspects of their carbon foot print -- fleet fuel, electricity,
    gas, refrigerants. It is fully compliant with the Australian government's <a
    href="http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/initiatives/national-greenhouse-energy-reporting.aspx">NGERS</a>
    legislation.</li>

    <li>Developed and deployed a carbon emissions modelling tool called <a
    href="http://kinesis.org/c-cap-city.html">CCap City</a>. CCap City allows councils to account for the carbon
    footprint of an entire Local Government Area (LGA) and models the effects of policy changes. Policies include
    improvements in public transport, lighting and appliance efficiency, vehicle efficiency standards, the installation
    of co-generation (aka. combined heat and power (CHP), tri-generation), purchase of green power, solar hot water
    systems, solar photovoltaics to name just a few. The tool incorporates a sophisticated modelling engine, GIS
    capabilities, and an intuitive interface.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Software Engineer, System Administrator: Munch Crunch
  Organics (Nov 2008 to Dec 2009)</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Developed an online store, <a
  href="http://munchcrunchorganics.com.au">munchcrunchorganics.com.au</a>,
  for an Organic Home Delivery business. It was built from scratch
  after deciding Drupal didn't fit the specific and evolving
  requirements of a new business venture. Integrated with Paypal, it
  also includes extensive
  administrative capabilities to add/remove/change price of products,
  track and provide statistical data about customers. Also integrated
  with an SMS gateway and Twitter.</li>

  <li>Technologies: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, nginx, Phusion
    Passenger, Linux</li>

  <li>Also planted, irrigated, weeded and picked organic produce
    and assisted in the management of an organic farm.</li>
  <li>I now maintain the website from Sydney.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Research Engineer: RedLizard Software/NICTA (Nov 2006 &ndash; Jul 2008. Jul 2009 &ndash; Dec 2009)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lead developer from Nov 2006 to July 2008.</li>
  <li>Developing a static analysis tool, <a
      href="http://redlizards.com">Goanna</a>,
      that finds memory
    leaks, null pointer dereferences, bad coding practises, etc, in
    C/C++ programs.</li>
  <li>Took over the administration and development of redlizards.com website from
    contractor.</li>
  <li>Goanna is written in OCaml (a strict, strongly-typed functional
    programming language). The website is a combination of
    Joomla, phpBB and WordPress containing a significant amount of
    custom code. Goanna, being a developer tool, needs to run on a variety of
    systems: Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin/Windows, MinGW/Windows. Also
    worked on a plug-in, written in Java, for the Eclipse IDE.</li>
  <li>Set up the issue tracker, FogBugz, and the Subversion revision control system.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Software Engineer and Systems Administrator: Dawson Media (Aug 2006 &ndash; Mar
  2007. July 2008 &ndash; present)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I developed and maintain an in-house, internal customer relationship
      manager (CRM) for tracking Dawson Media (aka Sydney Pink Pages)
      customers, their products and contact history.</li>
  <li>I took over development of and maintain,
      <a href="http://stats.directclicks.com.au">DirectClicks</a>, a web
      application that provides customers with data about their managed
      Google Adwords spending, calls to their allocated 1300 numbers
      and email they have received.

</ul>

<h3>Tutor: University of New Wouth Wales (early 2003 &ndash; late 2005)</h3>
<p> Assisted in the teaching of the Haskell programming language
to first year students. This involved, at various stages, marking,
design of assignments, monitoring and answering of email, and
teaching. This was my job while I was a PhD candidate.</p>

<h3>Tutor: University of Queensland (early 1999 - late 2001)</h3>
<p>Tutored various subjects in Mathematics and Computer Science
while I was an undergraduate.</p>

<h3>Research Assistant: University of Queensland (Summer of
2000/2001)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Assisted Dr George Havas in investigating the pathological
      algorithmic behaviour of transforming matrices over fields  to Hermite Normal
      Form.
  </li>
  <li>Mercury, Linux</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research Assistant: University of Queensland (Summer of
1999/2000)</h3>

      program
  </li>
  <li>C, Linux</li>
</ul>

<h3>How I got into functional programming</h3>

<li>In 2001 a friend of mine told me about a course he was taking that I was unfortunately unable
     to take (as I had no electives to spare). He sat me down in front of a terminal and showed
     me a language called Haskell. I was immediately hooked and set out to learn it by myself over
     that summer.</li>

<li>I undertook an honours project looking at a particular style of functional programming</li>

<li>I embarked upon a PhD in 2002. The thesis was completed and submitted in 2006 and was
    called "Language Extension via Dynamically Extensible Compilers". The thesis was inspired by
    Haskell's (and other functional languages) ability to create libraries that, in a sense,
    were tiny Domain Specific Languages. Scoobi, the library I had a small part in developing
    early on, exemplifies this approach.</li>

<li>After completing my thesis I worked at NICTA on the Goanna project. Goanna is a tool which
 finds bugs in C programs. However, it is written in OCaml. Functional languages are very good
  at writing compilers and programs to analyse programs. They are sometimes called "domain
   specific languages for writing compilers".</li>

<li>In late 2010 I started work with Rami Mukhtar and Ben Lever. Initially I was working on
 Accelerate, a Haskell library for writing high-level descriptions of highly parallel
  programs that run on GPUs.
The approaches used in that library could also be applicable to Big Data.</li>

<li>I then moved laterally within NICTA to work on program verification. NICTA is the first
 research institute in the world to have verified an operating system kernel. Program verification
 is the highest level of assurance of program correctness you can get and a lot of functional
  programming techniques are used in program verification. (The theorem prover itself is
  written in Standard ML, a close cousin of OCaml.)</li>

<h3>Open Source Projects/Recreational coding</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://js1k.com/2012-love/demo/1167">Aleph You</a> &mdash; my submission to the 2012 "Love" themed <a href="js1k.com">JS1K</a> competition. Rule is: create something cool in the HTML canvas in less than 1024 bytes.</p>
  <p>A much faster (and better looking) version of this can be found <a href="http://seanseefried.org/effects/heart-glsl/">here</a> but this one requires WebGL to be enabled in your browser.
  Relies on the power of higher order functions and also has a mini-code generator in it. Written in JavaScript, prototyped in Haskell.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>Animated <a href="http://seanseefried.org/effects/factor-diagrams/">factor diagrams</a>.
      All numbers have a unique prime factorisation and this little program animates that.
      The dots group themselves together in little groups of primes. e.g. 30 is represented as
      5 groups of 3 groups of 2. Further <a href="http://mathlesstraveled.com/2012/10/05/factorization-diagrams/">explanation</a> can be found at Brent Yorgey's site.
      This is another example of a program that relies on the power of higher-order functions. Again, prototyped in Haskell, written in JavaScript.
    </li>

  <li><a href="http://playspace.seanseefried.org">PlaySpace Online</a> &mdash; A web application that allows you to write interactive 3D effects in Conal Elliott's Shady language.
    Web server, compiler and GLSL compiler writte completely in Haskell, with a small amount of JavaScript on the client side.
  </li>

  <li>A re-implementation of the
      <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~sseefried/pan/index.html">Pan</a>
      Embedded Domain Specific Language -- a language for the composition
      of interactive images and animations.
  </li>

  <li>
      Contributed to a branch
      of the <a href="http://haskell.org/ghc">GHC</a> compiler that allowed one to extend the optimisations of
      the compiler using plug-ins.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.numbertheory.org/calc/">CALC</a>, a number theory calculator.</li>
</ul>
