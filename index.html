<h2>Talks/Presentations/Essays</h2>

<p>I am passionately interested in sustainability, particularly limits
to growth, ecological economics, and steady-state economics. I have
given a number of talks at the conference <em>Students of Sustainability</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://olivedrab.id.au/files/Limits_to_Growth_SOS_2009.pdf">Limits
      to Growth</a>
  </li>
      
  <li><a href="http://olivedrab.id.au/files/Flawed_Assumption_Neoclassical_Economics.pdf">
      Flawed Assumptions in Neoclassical Economics</a>
  </li>
      
  <li>A portion of the <em>Limits to Growth</em> talk can be
      found on YouTube <a
      href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT06ign4BEM">here</a>.
  </li>

  <li>I have also written essays about energy security and the
  fundamental limitations we operate under in exploiting new sources
  at <a href="http://olivedrab.id.au">Olive Drab</a>. The two
  I'd recommend reading most are <a
  href="http://olivedrab.id.au/blog/files/1fec090842ae2dbaeb3a20a07fcd0c98-5.html">Transformity
  and transitioning to renewable energy</a> and <a
  href="http://olivedrab.id.au/blog/files/13-july-2008.html">Sorry Al,
  you're not taking transformity into account</a>.
